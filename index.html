<h2>
    Getting a puppy
</h2>

<p>
    During the summer we spent a lot of time getting ready for the new puppy. We started by deciding what puppy we were going to get. This debate lasted until Christmas when we decided we would get a Havanese. We got in touch with a breeder and they said they had a litter born the week of Christmas we could look at. Mum and Dad went to see the breeder and decided yes we would get one of her puppys. We then bought lots of stuff for the puppy sich as:
    <li>Puppy Pen</li>
    <li>Lead</li>
    <li>Crate</li> 
    <li>Bedding</li>
    <li>Toys</li>
   We built a fence to keep the puppy in annd tidyed the house so the puppy won't chew everything. We are now ready for our puppy to move in on 24th of Febuary.
